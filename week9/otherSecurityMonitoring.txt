things to monitor:
    security groups - monitoring rules for your ec2 instances to ensure that people can't, for example, ssh from anywhere
        ec2 client
        describe_security_groups, using IpPermissions
        revoke_security_group_ingress, to handle offending rules
    s3 buckets - ensuring buckets have policies set up properly
        s3 client
        get_bucket_policy
        put_bucket_policy
    efs - similar to s3, ensuring that efs filesystems have the correct policies
        efs client
        describe_file_system_policy
        put_file_system_policy
